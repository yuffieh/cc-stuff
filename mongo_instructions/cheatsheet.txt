

To install the MongoDB binaries, issue the following command in a system shell:


$ brew install mongodb




Run MongoDB

Create the data directory.
Before you start MongoDB for the first time, create the directory to which the mongod process will write data. By default, the mongod process uses the /data/db directory. If you create a directory other than this one, you must specify that directory in the dbpath option when starting the mongod process later in this procedure.

The following example command creates the default /data/db directory:

sudo mkdir -p /data/db




Set permissions for the data directory.
Before running mongod for the first time, ensure that the user account running mongod has read and write permissions for the directory.


If you want to view the current file permissions on a file or folder, change the directory to the folder containing the file or folder, and then run the ls -l command.



Run MongoDB.
To run MongoDB, run the mongod process at the system prompt. 
If necessary, specify the path of the mongod or the data directory. 

See the following examples.

Run without specifying paths
If your system PATH variable includes the location of the mongod binary and if you use the default data directory (i.e., /data/db), simply enter mongod at the system prompt:

mongod
Specify the path of the mongod
If your PATH does not include the location of the mongod binary, enter the full path to the mongod binary at the system prompt:

<path to binary>/mongod
Specify the path of the data directory
If you do not use the default data directory (i.e., /data/db), specify the path to the data directory using the --dbpath option:

mongod --dbpath <path to data directory>


$ cd ~
$ pwd
/Users/mkyong
$ touch .bash_profile
$ vim .bash_profile


use VIM to add these 2 lines to .bash_profile

export MONGO_PATH=/usr/local/mongodb
export PATH=$PATH:$MONGO_PATH/bin


To exit VIM hit escape then :wq
##restart terminal

$ mongo -version


Think of Mongo Db as it's own server so...

You run mongod in one terminal window.
 And you should see it start up and listen on port whatever...

Then you open a second terminal window...

and you can now talk to the admin account on the mongo db server by typing

$ mongo

you should see it say connecting to test if that's working. 

test is the default database or "collection" for startup

now type

$ db

this shows the DB you are currently connected to 

$ show dbs 

shows your databases

If you donâ€™t want to use the default /data/db folder, just specify an alternate path with --dbpath when you start mongod

$ mongod --dbpath /any-directory



If u get this soft rlimit error it's not important on a dev environment
ulimit -n 2048 && mongod; will fix it when u start mongo



Begin using MongoDB.


Before deploying MongoDB in a production environment, consider the Production Notes document.

Later, to stop MongoDB, press Control+C in the terminal where the mongod instance is running.

Introduction

The mongo shell is an interactive JavaScript interface to MongoDB. You can use the mongo shell to query and update data as well as perform administrative operations.

The mongo shell is a component of the MongoDB distributions. Once you have installed and have started MongoDB, connect the mongo shell to your running MongoDB instance.

Most examples in the MongoDB Manual use the mongo shell; however, many drivers provide similar interfaces to MongoDB.

IMPORTANT
Ensure that MongoDB is running before attempting to start the mongo shell.



 start the mongo shell and connect to your MongoDB instance running on localhost with default port:





















Example:
If you want to create a database with name <mydb>, then use DATABASE statement would be as follows:

>use mydb
switched to db mydb
To check your currently selected database use the command db

>db
mydb
If you want to check your databases list, then use the command show dbs.

>show dbs
local     0.78125GB
test      0.23012GB
Your created database (mydb) is not present in list. To display database you need to insert atleast one document into it.

>db.movie.insert({"name":"tutorials point"})
>show dbs
local      0.78125GB
mydb       0.23012GB
test       0.23012GB
In mongodb default database is test. If you didn't create any database then collections will be stored in test database.
